# Musicon - Code Academy Project

In this project, I was to incorporate my knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Handlebars to make a multi-page interactive website.

Key tasks:
- Create a navigation bar using unordered lists, anchor tags, and class attributes.
- Style the website using your knowledge of display, positioning, color, and font declarations.
- Build out semantic templates using a client-side templating engine: Handlebars.
- Display relevant information using JavaScript objects, arrays, and control flow alongside built-in Handlebars iteration and control flow helpers.
